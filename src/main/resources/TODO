1   Write unit test for existing functionalities
   1a   use enterprise standards- beforeAll, beforeEach, afterEach,afterAll as needed
   1b   make sure that the tests are interacting with the database - jdbc template and all
            use former tests in the data mig dao

2.   Implement a login
    2a  Determine where to leverage a third party login service like Auth{0} or code it
    2b  If coded, implement login credentials validation (ensure all tests are running against a live database)
    2c  To login, ask if user is "existing", then check if user credentials is already inside the cache memory
            (see datamig dao for examples)
            if user name and password are not in cache, fetch from database and add to cache
    2d  if user is a "new user", call "create new user" , and insert user login credentials into the db table
        **Note, if user attempt to login the secound time, thier login creds should be added to cache and fetch from
        cache memory

        create user table
            CREATE TABLE user
            (
                attendee_id  SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                user_name    varchar(60) NOT NULL,
                user_password varchar(60) NOT NULL,
                first_name   varchar(30) NOT NULL,
                last_name    varchar(30) NOT NULL,
                title        varchar(40) NULL,
                company      varchar(50) NULL,
                email        varchar(80) NOT NULL,
                phone_number varchar(20) NULL
            );
3.  Registering conference
        Let user be able to search conferences, but when they click the "register buttom", the login page is called.
